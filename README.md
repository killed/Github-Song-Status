# Note

This isn't completely done I need to work on finding out the rate limit because currently it'll delete your lastfm api key for spamming too much

# Setup

Firstly you will need to obtain a Last FM and Github API key and you can get them from here -

[https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

[https://www.last.fm/api/](https://www.last.fm/api/)

Once you've got them you'll need to head into the `\data\` folder and then you'll see a file called `config.json` open that up and change the api keys and username to your lastfm username

Finally

Follow ya boy on lastfm [https://www.last.fm/user/js](https://www.last.fm/user/js)
